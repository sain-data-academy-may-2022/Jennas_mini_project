## J's Costalot!

## Manifesto

To build an app that will charge customer's an extortionate amount of money for very easy to make and cheap to produce items, whilst providing a terrible customer service. 

## Running

Know something about coding I guess. Then just run it in python and follow the instructions. Thats all I do, apart from the knowing about coding bit, Connor does that.

## USP

The apps USP of poor service was designed specifically to set user expectations and ensure they are not let down when my amateur coding inevitably brakes. Also, allowed me to embrace poor customer service despite it being a core "principle" of my working career for the last 14 years!.
