## Spec

Your Client has launched a pop-up cafe in a busy business district offering delivered home-made lunches and refreshements to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software app which helps them to log and track orders.

## App Manifesto

To build an app that will charge customer's an extortionate amount of money for very easy to make and cheap to produce items, whilst providing a terrible customer service. 

## Running

Know something about coding I guess. Just run it in python, follow the instructions and some stuff happens in something called SQL with a databse thingy. Thats all I do, apart from the knowing about coding bit, I just steal that!

## USP

The apps USP of poor service was designed specifically to set user expectations and ensure they are not let down when my amateur coding inevitably brakes. Also, allowed me to embrace poor customer service despite it being a core "principle" of my working career for the last 14 years!
